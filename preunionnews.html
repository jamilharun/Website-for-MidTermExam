                <p>Van Adrian Maxilom, a former basketball player of CYS (Clan Youthful School)
                    has made a tremendous breakthrough in his athletic career. A lot of his
                    notable achievements were being a part of the WCSU (West Cavite Sports 
                    Unit) Men's basketball team and won silver, joined the DICES (Diocese of 
                    Imus Catholic Education System) which they also won, and then he became 
                    part of a 3-peat championship (won 3 times) back in his Senior Highschool
                    days. Fast-forward today, he strengthened his body during the pandemic 
                    in their own gym and then after that, he started doing trainings with the
                    Philippine Rowing team. Then with their continuous training, he eventually 
                    got to be a part of the national team and became one of the qualified 
                    members of the Philippine rosters in the Men's Rowing team in the upcoming 
                    SEA Games this May 2022 in Hanoi, Vietnam together with Tokyo Olympian 
                    Cris Niervarez. What is even more impressive is that this will be his 
                    FIRST competition in rowing.

                <h2>Pandemic Break Up</h2>
                <p>Recently, celebrity chef Manaba and actress Minerva
                    has broken up.
                    
                    according to PEP.ph, chef Manaba said that their long distance
                    relationship has been the reason of their break up.
                    
                    "To be honest, being in a LDR has been dificult for us, it was hard
                    for the both of us" chef Manaba stated "we didn't expect it
                    to be this difficult. We tried." 
                    
                    They broke up in December, they were suppose to celebrate their 5th 
                    anniversary on February.
                    
                    both parties agreed to the break up.
                    
                    they both started their LDR back in 2020 because of the pandemic actress
                    Minerva had to go home in Italy
                    
                    chef Manaba was also a singer while actress Minerva was
                    a theater performer and has a youtube channel.
                    
                    "as time went by, it became too much for us, both of us were both 
                    struggling with this" said chef Manaba. "maintaining our 
                    relationship was starting to get difficult, it's hard when your 
                    partner isn't ther with you along the way."
                    
                    chef Manaba also said that getting back to the Philippines was
                    difficult because of the safety percautions during the pandemic.
                    
                    "Up until now, she's still in Italy, the flights were always fully booked
                    and the safety precautions was a nightmare." said chef Manaba
                    
                    regardless, they still remained friends, there were no hard feelings 
                    involved.
