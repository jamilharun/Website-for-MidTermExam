                spoiled by habits of being cynical as well. His adaptability though, this is what he's most well-liked for. There are many times when friends count on this 
                and his courage whenever they need help. Nobody's perfect of course and name has plenty of rainy days too. His desperation and amoral nature tend to get in

                the other hand, is what makes him so popular. When friends are sad, they rely on this and his resourcefulness on a regular basis. No one is perfect, and Caleb

                 their enthusiasm when they need support or help.  Of course, no one is perfect, and so Angelica. Her pitiful personality and coldness are not the best 
                 companions and can ruin many nights. Fortunately, their accuracy usually mitigates the worst.
