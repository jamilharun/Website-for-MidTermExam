                    <h1>Good day, everyone! <br>
                        I welcome you all to this magnificent occasion of our batch 1990-1991 batch alumni meet with much respect and joy.
                        This day is significant because it allows everyone to reconnect after such a long period of time.
                        It also helps us all in recognizing together with our friends that like families to us the numerous changes and occasions that the college has undergone in recent years.
                        I understand that time does not stand still for anyone, and I appreciate you taking the time away from work schedule to be here.
                        But one thing is certain: you will miss your university days by the end of the visit.
                        The memory you take home at the end of this wondrous event will be worth the hassle you all sacrificed today.
                        Last but not least, I would like everyone to participate today. Hope you all like the arrangement made for your reunion. 
                        Wish you a wonderful time remembering the past. Have a good time ahead. Thank you! <br><br><br>

                        has made a tremendous breakthrough in his athletic career. A lot of his
                        notable achievements were being a part of the WCSU (West Cavite Sports 
                        Unit) Men's basketball team and won silver, joined the DICES (Diocese of 
                        Imus Catholic Education System) which they also won, and then he became 
                        part of a 3-peat championship (won 3 times) back in his Senior Highschool
                        days. Fast-forward today, he strengthened his body during the pandemic 
                        in their own gym and then after that, he started doing trainings with the
                        Philippine Rowing team. Then with their continuous training, he eventually 
                        got to be a part of the national team and became one of the qualified 
                        members of the Philippine rosters in the Men's Rowing team in the upcoming 
                        SEA Games this May 2022 in Hanoi, Vietnam together with Tokyo Olympian 
                        Cris Niervarez. What is even more impressive is that this will be his 
                        FIRST competition in rowing.
